/* 
Temperature Convertor

Instructions:
Write code that asks the user for a temperature in Celsius and converts it to Fahrenheit. 
Bonus: ask the user first if they want to convert from F to C or C to F.

/*
My logic in English...

Ask the user for a value
convert the value from a string to a number
do some math wizardry to convert the number from Celsius to Fahrenheit
convert the value back from a number to a string -- possibly unecessary with JavaScript due
to type conversion?
display the new value

Bonus
as if the user's value is Celsius or Fahrenheit
get value
if Celsius, follow the logic outlined above
if Farenheit, do a different set of steps (same logic as above,
except the math wizardry converts F to C)
else, tell the user to choose c or f!
display the old value and the new value and the scale for each one
